# GhostTab

A Velocity proxy plugin that enhances the tab list with:

- **Online players** showing how long they have been online (e.g. `Steve 1h 23m`)
- **Recently offline players ("ghosts")** showing how long they have been offline (e.g. `Alex offline 2h 15m`)

Offline players remain visible for a configurable window (default **24 hours**).

## Features

- Live updating times (default every 30 seconds)
- Configurable header / footer with placeholders `{online}`, `{ghosts}`, `{total_hours}`, `{playtime_window}`
- Footer can show total hours played by all players in a rolling window (default 12 hours)
- Configurable display formats using MiniMessage
- Persists recent player data and playtime sessions across proxy restarts
- Online players sorted by session length (longest online at the top)
- Offline/ghost players sorted by offline time (longest offline at the bottom)
- Caches player skins so ghosts keep their real skin after disconnect/reboot
- No dependency on backend plugins or VelocityTab

## Requirements

- Velocity 3.3+
- Java 17+

## Installation

1. Download the latest `GhostTab.jar` from Releases (or build it yourself)
2. Place it in your Velocity `plugins/` folder
3. Restart / start the proxy
4. Edit `plugins/ghosttab/config.yml` as desired
5. Restart or reload if you add a reload command later

**Important:** Disable or remove VelocityTab / Velocitab if you are using this plugin, otherwise they will conflict over the tab list.

## Building

```bash
mvn clean package
```

The shaded jar will be in `target/GhostTab.jar`.

## Configuration

See `config.yml` for all options:

```yaml
offline-window-hours: 24
update-interval-seconds: 30
playtime-window-hours: 12
header: "<gold><bold>A Zombie Pigman Broke My Door</bold></gold>"
footer: "<gray>Players have played a total of <white>{total_hours}</white> hours in the last {playtime_window} hours</gray>"
online-format: "<white>{name} <gray>{time}</gray>"
offline-format: "<dark_gray>{name} <gray>offline {time}</gray>"
```

## Notes

- Ghost player skins are cached from when they were last online and restored after disconnect/reboot.
- The plugin tracks players that connect through the proxy. Players who only ever joined backends directly will not appear.
- Times are approximate and update on the configured interval.
